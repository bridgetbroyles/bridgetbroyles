**ML & Data:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, NumPy, pandas (WIP, still learning)
**Tools & Dev:** Git, Docker, VS Code, CI/CD  
**Other:** Embedded systems (Arduino), discrete math foundations, linear algebra

## Experience & highlights
- Mentored students through reinforcement learning labs and debugging ML agents.  
- Building and deploying multiple small projects with performance benchmarks and tests.
