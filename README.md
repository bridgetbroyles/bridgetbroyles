# Bridget Broyles
Computer Science major • University of Texas at Austin • 

## About
I am a computer science student who loves machine learning, full stack development, and building tools that help others learn. I enjoy end-to-end projects: prototyping models, building user interfaces, and deploying small services. I'm always still learning and would love to connect with anyone with similar passions.

## Favorite projects
- **PacMan Imitation Learning** — Perceptron-based agent that imitates player behavior; includes dataset collection, training pipeline, and evaluation. Taught at UTCS Summer Academies 2025 to seniors in highschool. *(Python, PyTorch)*  
- **Huffman Compressor** — Bit-level file compression/decompression with Java I/O optimizations; includes tests and performance analysis. Typically reduces files size by around 60%. *(Java)*  
- **Teaching Tools** — Classroom utilities for Arduino + C++ LED patterns used in CS outreach workshops. Spread across various files, *(C++, Arduino)*

## Skills
**Languages:** Python, C++, Java, JavaScript  
**ML & Data:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, NumPy, pandas *(WIP, still learning)*
**Tools & Dev:** Git, Docker, VS Code, CI/CD  
**Other:** Embedded systems (Arduino), discrete math foundations, linear algebra

## Experience & highlights
- Mentored students through reinforcement learning labs and debugging ML agents.  
- Building and deploying multiple small projects with performance benchmarks and tests.
